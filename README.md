Welcome to Erin & Romelio's Furrever Cat Cafe! This website provides everything you need to know about our cafe, including our location, menu, the adorable cats you can meet, and the heartfelt story behind our mission.

At Furrever Cat Cafe, we strive to create a loving shelter for cats without homes. Our goal is to feed, care for, and provide them with the love and attention they deserve, dedicating all our energy to making their lives better.

## Personal Note

This is a passion project inspired by The Odin Project curriculum. Through this project, I aim to apply everything I've learned about web development while continuing to grow my skills. Iâ€™m eager to learn more and excited to make this project a success!
